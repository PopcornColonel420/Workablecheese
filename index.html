  <h1>Types of Energy - Geothermal</h1>
  
  <h2>What is Geothermal Energy?</h2>
  <p>
    Geothermal energy is the heat derived from the Earth's core. It is a renewable source of energy that can be used for heating and electricity generation. Geothermal power plants harness the steam or hot water produced from geothermal reservoirs deep within the Earth.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Advantages of Geothermal Energy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Renewable and sustainable</li>
    <li>Low greenhouse gas emissions</li>
    <li>Continuous and reliable power supply</li>
    <li>Minimal land use compared to other power sources</li>
    <li>Can be used for heating and cooling in addition to electricity generation</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Disadvantages of Geothermal Energy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High upfront costs for drilling and infrastructure</li>
    <li>Geographically limited to areas with suitable geothermal resources</li>
    <li>Potential for ground subsidence or seismic activity</li>
    <li>Requires careful management of geothermal fluids to avoid environmental impacts</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Examples of Geothermal Energy Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Geothermal energy is used in various applications, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Electricity generation in power plants</li>
    <li>Heating and cooling systems for residential and commercial buildings</li>
    <li>Industrial processes such as drying crops or generating steam for manufacturing</li>
    <li>Greenhouse farming for year-round crop production</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Geothermal energy is a valuable and sustainable source of power that utilizes the Earth's natural heat. Despite some limitations, it offers numerous advantages and is becoming increasingly important in the transition to cleaner energy sources.
