<h2>Theory Questions</h2>

<h3>1. Define internet backbone in your own words.</h3>
<p>The internet backbone refers to the high-speed, high-capacity network infrastructure that forms the core of the internet. It consists of major network links and routers that connect various networks and provide the primary pathway for data transmission between different regions and countries.</p>

<h3>2. What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</h3>
<p>On the internet, clients and servers are two different types of computers. Clients are user devices such as computers, smartphones, or tablets that request and consume resources or services from servers. Servers, on the other hand, are powerful computers that store and deliver resources or services to clients upon request.</p>

<h3>3. Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, workstations, and other hardware components are part of the internet.</h3>
<p>At a high level, servers, routers, switches, workstations, and other hardware components are interconnected to form the internet infrastructure. Servers store and provide resources or services, routers direct data traffic between networks, switches connect devices within a network, workstations are user devices, and other hardware components such as modems, firewalls, and load balancers play specific roles in ensuring connectivity and security within the internet.</p>

<h3>4. Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.</h3>
<p>The Internet Protocol Suite, also known as TCP/IP, is a set of protocols that enables communication between devices over the internet. It consists of multiple layers, including the application layer, transport layer, internet layer, and network access layer. TCP/IP provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships by encapsulating data into packets, assigning IP addresses for identification and routing, ensuring reliable transmission through protocols like TCP, and handling addressing, routing, and delivery of packets across interconnected networks.</p>

<h3>5. List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Email services</li>
  <li>Web hosting services</li>
  <li>File sharing services</li>
</ul>

<h3>6. What is hypertext?</h3>
<p>Hypertext is a method of organizing and presenting information in a non-linear way, allowing users to navigate through related pieces of text or multimedia by selecting hyperlinks. It enables interconnectedness between different pieces of content, providing a non-linear and interactive browsing experience.</p>

<h3>7. How is "the web" related to the internet?</h3>
<p>The web, short for World Wide Web, is a system of interconnected hypertext documents and resources that are accessed through the internet. While the internet is the global network infrastructure that connects various networks and devices, the web is an application or service that operates on top of the internet, allowing users to access and navigate web pages using web browsers.</p>

<h3>8. Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction.</h3>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext over the internet. It facilitates client/server interaction by defining a set of rules for how a client (web browser) and a server communicate and exchange data. The client sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying the desired resource, and the server responds with an HTTP response containing the requested resource or appropriate status codes and headers.</p>

<h3>9. What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</h3>
<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It operates on top of TCP/IP and is primarily designed for unencrypted communication. HTTP is not secure, meaning the data exchanged between client and server can be intercepted or modified by malicious entities.</p>
<p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption mechanisms, typically SSL/TLS, to establish a secure and encrypted connection between the client and server. It ensures that the data transmitted is encrypted and protected, making it much more difficult for attackers to intercept or tamper with the communication.</p>

<h3>10. Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</h3>
<p>Web 1.0: In the Web 1.0 era, websites were predominantly static and read-only. They were designed to deliver information to users, who could only passively consume the content. Websites consisted mainly of text and images, and user interaction was limited.</p>
<p>Web 2.0: With the advent of Web 2.0, the web became more dynamic and interactive. User-generated content and social media platforms emerged, allowing users to create, share, and interact with content. Web 2.0 emphasized user participation, collaboration, and the creation of online communities.</p>
<p>Web 3.0: Web 3.0, also known as the Semantic Web, represents the next phase of web development. It aims to make information more meaningful and accessible to both humans and machines. Web 3.0 focuses on technologies like artificial intelligence, linked data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling smarter search, personalized recommendations, and seamless integration of data from various sources.</p>

<h3>11. Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.</h3>

<p>- Web 1.0 focused on delivering information, while Web 2.0 emphasized user-generated content and social interactions.</p>
<p>- Web 2.0 allowed users to actively participate, collaborate, and share content, while Web 1.0 had limited user interaction.</p>
<p>- Web 3.0 aims to make information more meaningful and accessible to both humans and machines, leveraging technologies like AI, linked data, and IoT.</p>

<h3>12. Describe the role markup languages play in the Web.</h3>
<p>Markup languages provide a standardized way to structure and format content on the web. They define the syntax and rules for annotating text with tags or elements, allowing web browsers to interpret and render the content correctly. Markup languages like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provide the foundation for creating web pages, specifying the structure, layout, and presentation of the content.</p>

<h3>13. Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages.</h3>
<p>Markup languages, such as HTML and XML, are used for structuring and formatting content on the web. They focus on describing the elements and hierarchy of the content, defining how it should be presented or interpreted.</p>
<p>Scripting languages, such as JavaScript, are used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. They allow for the execution of scripts or code that can manipulate the content, respond to user actions, and interact with servers or other external resources.</p>

<h3>14. Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).</h3>
<p>- Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is a standard for defining markup languages, which served as the foundation for HTML and XML.</p>
<p>- Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that allows for the definition of custom tags and structured data. It is a versatile language used for representing and exchanging data.</p>
<p>- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web. It defines the structure and layout of web pages, specifying how elements should be displayed.</p>
<p>- Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is an XML-based version of HTML, which follows stricter rules of XML syntax and is compatible with both HTML and XML parsers.</p>
<p>- Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML) refers to a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.</p>
<p>- Markdown (MD) is a lightweight markup language designed for creating formatted text using a simple syntax. It is commonly used for writing content that can be easily converted to HTML or other formats.</p>
