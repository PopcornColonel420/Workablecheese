  <h1>Types of Engines</h1>

  <h2><a href="#v6">V6 Engine</a></h2>
  <img src="v6_engine_diagram.png" alt="V6 Engine Diagram">
  <p>
    The <em>V6 engine</em>, as the name suggests, has six cylinders arranged in a "V" configuration. This type of engine offers a good balance between power and fuel efficiency. The cylinders are typically divided into two banks, with three cylinders each, forming the shape of a "V". V6 engines are commonly used in mid-sized cars, SUVs, and some smaller trucks. They are known for providing smooth performance and decent power output.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="#v8">V8 Engine</a></h2>
  <img src="v8_engine_diagram.png" alt="V8 Engine Diagram">
  <p>
    The <em>V8 engine</em> is a larger and more powerful engine compared to the V6. It has eight cylinders arranged in a "V" configuration, with four cylinders on each side. This engine type is popular among performance-oriented vehicles, such as sports cars and full-size trucks. V8 engines provide high power output, excellent acceleration, and a distinctive exhaust note. However, they generally consume more fuel than smaller engine types.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="#inline4">Inline 4-Cylinder Engine</a></h2>
  <img src="inline_4_engine_diagram.png" alt="Inline 4-Cylinder Engine Diagram">
  <p>
    The <em>inline 4-cylinder engine</em>, also known as a straight-four engine, features four cylinders aligned in a single row. This engine type is compact, lightweight, and commonly used in small to mid-sized cars. Inline 4 engines are known for their fuel efficiency and smooth operation. They provide a good balance between power and economy, making them a popular choice for everyday vehicles.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="#boxer">Boxer Engine</a></h2>
  <img src="boxer_engine_diagram.png" alt="Boxer Engine Diagram">
  <p>
    The <em>boxer engine</em>, also called a flat engine, has horizontally opposed cylinders. The cylinders are placed on opposite sides of the crankshaft, resulting in a low center of gravity. This engine configuration is primarily used by Subaru and some Porsche models. The boxer engine's design provides improved stability, better handling, and a unique engine sound. It also offers good performance and is often associated with all-wheel-drive systems.
  </p>

  <h2><a href="#wankel">Wankel Rotary Engine</a></h2>
  <img src="wankel_engine_diagram.png" alt="Wankel Rotary Engine Diagram">
  <p>
    The <em>Wankel rotary engine</em> is a unique type of engine that uses a rotor instead of traditional pistons. The rotor rotates around an eccentric shaft within a housing, creating chambers that intake, compress, and exhaust gases. This engine design allows for high revolutions per minute (RPM) and compact size. Rotary engines are known for their smooth operation, high power output, and lightweight construction. They were notably used by Mazda in some of their sports cars.
